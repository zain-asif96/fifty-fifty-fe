                Information about our customers is an essential part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. Therefore, we share customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries FiftyFifty.io, Inc. controls that either is subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

                <ul>

In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Still, it remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that FiftyFifty.io or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

                        We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more valuable and relevant FiftyFifty ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve relevant ads from other advertisers.
